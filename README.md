# Capstone Project Proposal

## üçû The Bread Baker's App(rentice) üçû

### By: Elly Maimon

#### Project‚Äôs Purpose or Goal:

The goal of Bread Baker's (App)rentice is to provide a connected organization platform that home or professional bakers can use as a resource to aid in their baking of breads. 

Bakers will have the ability to create and sift through personal and community-created recipes, scale the recipes, keep track of their starters, keep notes on variables during the baking process, and visualize all aspects of the process in detail. 

#### Minimum Features

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
